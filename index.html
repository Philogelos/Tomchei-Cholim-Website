            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <!-- Background and Ethos /  Our Story -->
            <div>
                <p>In the winter of 1998/99, our founder, Yaakov Gluck, encountered a man undergoing dialysis who was struggling with the distress of his condition. Seeing his difficulties, Yaakov stepped in to help in any way he could. His acts of kindness did not go unnoticed‚Äîthe hospital staff at Royal Hospital were deeply impressed by his dedication, and in response, they went the extra mile in their care for the patient.</p>
                <p>After overcoming many challenges, the patient eventually moved to a care home. Later, when his granddaughter got married abroad, a special "second wedding" was arranged so that he could also take part in the celebrations. Community members gathered to make it a joyous occasion, demonstrating how one act of kindness had sparked a movement of compassion and support.</p>
                <img src="img/vollunteer-handing -package-to-senior-patient.png" alt="Vollunteer with senior patient">
                <p>This attention to the needs of a single patient became the foundation for what is now Tomchei Cholim. Our core ethos remains unchanged‚Äîa deep commitment to each individual patient, ensuring their needs are met with dignity, care, and kindness.</p>
                <p>Today, we have over 60 volunteers with a wide range of skills, yet the common thread uniting them is a kind heart and a true desire to help others.</p>

                <h3>The Sabbath Package</h3>
                <img src="img/Shalosh-Seudah-package.png" alt="◊©◊ú◊© ◊°◊¢◊ï◊ì◊î Package">
                <p>To bring comfort and joy to those in need, we provide beautifully prepared traditional kosher food for Shabbat. Our packages include challah, grape juice, a newspaper, biscuits, and other essentials‚Äîensuring that patients and housebound individuals can still experience the sanctity of Shabbat in a meaningful way.</p>
            </section>

                <h3>Visits</h3>
                <img src="img/visiting-the-sick.png" alt="Visiting the sick">
                <p>Every recipient of the Sabbath Package is also visited by our dedicated volunteers, offering emotional support, companionship, and assistance wherever possible. These visits provide much-needed encouragement and practical help to those going through difficult times. </p>

                <h3>Car Service</h3>
                <img src="img/hospital-car-park.png" alt="Hospital car park">
                <p>Our newly launched <strong>Shabbos Car Service</strong> supports individuals who need to attend hospital on Shabbos for non-life-threatening situations‚Äîparticularly where the regular Jewish ambulance service does not operate, as it is reserved for emergencies only.</p>

                <p>This is where Tomchei Cholim steps in. We provide trained drivers who are knowledgeable about the halachos (Jewish laws) of Shabbos. These volunteers assist passengers with tasks that would otherwise be prohibited‚Äîsuch as carrying bags from the house to the car, opening doors, and managing belongings upon arrival at the hospital.</p>
            
                <p>Importantly, payment is not made on Shabbos. All financial arrangements are handled afterwards, allowing patients to maintain full Shabbos observance with peace of mind.</p>
            
                <p>In emergency cases, patients are often taken to hospital by ambulance, but left stranded afterwards, with no Shabbos-safe way to return home. Our service fills that critical gap. Hospitals and A&E departments can contact our dedicated line, and we will dispatch a driver to bring the patient home under halachically appropriate conditions.</p>
            
                <p>This initiative ensures that individuals can access essential care when needed‚Äîwithout compromising their Shabbos observance.</p>

                <p>Welcoming a new life into the world is a special time, but it can also be exhausting. Our maternity ward packages include drinks, cakes, and other nourishing treats to provide an energy boost for new mothers as they recover and care for their newborns.</p>

                <p>We believe in the importance of celebrating Jewish traditions even in challenging times. Whether it‚Äôs Yom Tov, Purim, or another special occasion, we ensure those in need can observe and celebrate with dignity, providing festive food and other essentials.</p>

                <img src="img/new-kitchen.png" alt="New Kitchen">
                <p>To maintain the highest standards of cleanliness and kashrut, we are planning to build a dedicated kitchen. This will allow us to prepare meals under strict supervision, ensuring quality and adherence to dietary laws. Additionally, having our own kitchen will enable meals to be kept in hospital fridges and distributed by nurses on Shabbat, ensuring that no patient is left without a meal. Currently, patients who arrive on Shabbat often miss our standard distribution‚Äîthis initiative will solve that issue.</p>

                <h3>Dedicated Van for Homebound Patients</h3>

                <p>Homebound patients often experience a lower quality of life due to their limited mobility. We plan to acquire a dedicated van to assist with transportation, helping individuals attend doctor appointments, prayers, shopping trips, and even visits to the park. This initiative aims to combat loneliness, improve social engagement, and enhance their overall well-being. </p>

                <img src="img/hospital-breakfast.jpg" alt="Hospital breakfast">
                <p>Currently, there are very few kosher breakfast options available in UK hospitals. To address this, we plan to provide kosher breakfasts twice a week, ensuring that Jewish patients have access to nutritious, suitable meals during their hospital stay. </p>
